# AS6212-Arduino-Library
Arduino Software repository for the AMS AS6212 Temperature Sensor

### AMS AS6212 Temperature Sensor


The highest performing AS6212 has an accuracy of +/- 0.2°C from -10°C to 65 °C. It provides a resolution of 16 bit over the wide temperature range from -40°C to 125°C. The integrated alarm functionality enables micro-controller wake-up calls on defined temperature thresholds. An internal voltage regulator allows stable accuracy independent of the supply voltage between 1.71V to 3.6V. For power sensitive applications, the device can enter a low-power wait mode with 0.1μA current consumption.
